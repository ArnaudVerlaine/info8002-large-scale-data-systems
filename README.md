## Projects

### Programming project

See instructions in [`/project/`](https://github.com/glouppe/info8002-large-scale-data-systems/tree/master/project).

Your project should be submitted  by **December 20, 2019 at 23:59** on the [submission platform](https://submit.montefiore.ulg.ac.be/).

### Reading assignment

Your task is to read and summarize a scientific paper in the field of distributed systems. You are free to select one among the following three papers:

> - Ongaro and Ousterhout, "In Search of an Understandable Consensus Algorithm", 2014. [PDF](https://www.usenix.org/system/files/conference/atc14/atc14-paper-ongaro.pdf).
> - Calder et al, "Windows Azure Storage: A Highly Available Cloud Storage Service with Strong Consistency", 2011. [PDF](https://www.sigops.org/s/conferences/sosp/2011/current/2011-Cascais/printable/11-calder.pdf).
> - Basiri et al, "Automating chaos experiments in production", 2019. [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.04648.pdf)

You should produce a report that summarizes the problem that is tackled by the paper and explains why it is challenging or important. The report should outline the main contributions and results with respect to the problem that is addressed. It should also include a critical discussion of the advantages and shortcomings of the contributions of the paper.

Constraints:
- You can work in groups of maximum 3 students.
- You report must be written in English.
- Up to 4 pages (excluding references, if any).
- Formatted using the LaTeX template [`template-report-reading-assignment.tex`](https://glouppe.github.io/info8002-large-scale-data-systems/template-report-reading-assignment.tex).

Your report should be submitted  by **December 20, 2019 at 23:59** on the [submission platform](https://submit.montefiore.ulg.ac.be/).
