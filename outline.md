# Textbook

.center[![](figures/outline/textbook.jpg)]

The core content of this course (lectures 2 to 5) is based on the following textbook:

> .italic[Christian Cachin, Rachid Guerraoui, Luis Rodrigues, "Introduction to Reliable and Secure Distributed Programming", Springer.]

This textbook is **recommended**, although not required.

# Philosophy

## Solid ground

- Understand the **foundational principles** of distributed systems, on top of
which distributed *databases* and *computing* systems are operating.

## Practical

- Exposition to *industrial software*.
- Fun and challenging course project.

## Critical thinking

- Assess the benefits and disadvantages of data systems.
- No hype!

---

# Lectures

- Theoretical lectures
- Exercise sessions

---

# Outline

- Lecture 1: Introduction
- Lecture 2: Basic distributed abstractions
- Lecture 3: Reliable broadcast
- Lecture 4: Shared memory
- Lecture 5: Consensus
- Lecture 6: Blockchain
- Lecture 7: Cloud computing
- Lecture 8: Distributed hash tables
- Lecture 9: Distributed file systems

???

Maybe Lecture 10: Column stores?

# Projects

## Reading assignment

Read, summarize and criticize a major scientific paper in Large-Scale Data Systems.
(Paper to be announced later.)
