# Philosophy

## Solid ground

- Understand the **foundational principles** of distributed systems, on top of
which distributed *databases* and *computing* systems are operating.

## Practical

- Exposition to *industrial software*.
- Fun and challenging course project.

## Critical thinking

- Assess the benefits and disadvantages of distributed systems.
- No hype!
