# Goals and philosophy

## Solid ground

- Understand the **foundational principles** of distributed systems, on top of
which distributed *databases* and *computing* systems are operating.
- Understand why data systems are designed the way they are designed.

## Practical

- Fun and challenging course project.
- Practice and improve **your system engineering skills**!

## Critical thinking

- Assess the benefits and disadvantages of data systems.
- No hype!
