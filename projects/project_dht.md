class: center, middle

## Build your own Distributed Hash Table

---

# Constraints

To make your life a little bit easier, we will impose some constraints with regards to network programming.

Meaning, instead of having to program a custom network protocol, you will have to build a small REST API to exchange information with other peers. This also makes the verification process easier.

---

# Endpoints

These are the API endpoints you *have* to implement:

- `/ping` (GET)
- `/keys` (GET / POST)
- `/state` (GET)
- `/find` (POST)

---

# Deliverables

- A *report* (pdf) describing your architecture, implementation, and experiments you conducted.
- A *zip* file containing your implementation.
